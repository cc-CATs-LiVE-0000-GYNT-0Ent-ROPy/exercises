Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise 
(if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code, 
use the code from the solution 17), and instead of printing 
the results a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, 
just make up a name for the file you are saving to.
Extras:
    Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be 
    saved.
