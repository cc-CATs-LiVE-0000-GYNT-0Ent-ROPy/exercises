Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the 
numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime 
numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy 
numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by 
any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in 
mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation 
is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
